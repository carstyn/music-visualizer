## Description
Overall, my project is meant to, when given audio, render a reactive visual that is in sync with the audio. Using Pygame for rendering graphics and Librosa for audio analysis, it transforms MP3 or WAV files into a pulsing circle visualization that responds to the music's amplitude and beats (the flashing). Users can switch between different audio files through the program, change the color of the circle, and control playback (start/pause with spacebar). 

Originally, I wanted to add several different styles to the visual, but when I was experimenting with moving bars I kept getting an error and decided to put it on the backburner. One thing that I definitely should look into adding is a volume slider of some sort, as whenever I launch the program it's super loud and needs to be manually turned down. Another function I thought would be cool to add in the future is video exporting; where there would be a button to export MP4 files of visualizations generated with the visualizer.
