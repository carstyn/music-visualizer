# Interactive Music Visualizer

## Repository
https://github.com/carstyn/music-visualizer

## Description
A real-time visualizer that transforms audio input (e.g., MP3) into dynamic graphics, like pulsing shapes or color waves, synced to music.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of audio as a pulsing circle.
- Support for MP3 and WAV file playback with synced visuals.
- Keyboard controls for pausing/resuming audio (planned).
- Customizable color themes for visuals (planned).

## Challenges
- Ensuring precise sync between audio playback and visuals.
- Optimizing performance for long or high-bitrade audio files.
- Implementing Librosa, trying to have accurate beat detection
- Trying to find good UI designs, but keeping the program easy to navigate

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
 - A polished visualizer with beat detection, multiple visual styles (e.g., circles, bars), and color theme switching. Hoping for this to become a versitile tool for musicians creating music videos or artists experimenting with audio-visual art.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
 - A functional program that loads an audio file, plays it, and displays a pulsing circle synced to the audio's amplitude, with a clean and responsive interface.

## Milestones

- Week 1
    1. Load and play an audio file with basic amplitude detection using Librosa.
    2. Create initial Pygame window with a static visual

- Week 2
    1. Implement real-time visualization of audio amplitude
    2. Ensure audio playback syncs accurately with visuals.
    3. Add basic UI elements

- Week 3
    1. Add keyboard controls for pausing/resuming audio playback.
    2. Test performance with different audio files and optimize if needed.

- Week 4
    1. Experiment with beat detection using Librosa and integrate it into visuals.
    2. Implement color theme switching via keyboard input.
    3. Ensure that I meet minimal viable outcome and prepare demo.
